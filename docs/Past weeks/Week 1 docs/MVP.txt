- Core use cases: Register events and venues, create raffles, add songs and allow attendants to vote in order to listen to
the songs they want.
- Payment: Owners should be able to pay so that they can add their events and venues to the system
- Registration: Owners and atendants will register to the system using whatever credentials they want; administrators, on the
other hand, will be manually introduced into the database.
- Basic admin: Administrators must be able to suspend or ban owners or attendants if they misuse the system. A dashboard with
some information about the system should be available too.
