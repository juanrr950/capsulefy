Business Idea:
Our goal is to allow pubs owners to make  custom playlists so that the clients can vote which song
will play next. For that goal, our system will interact with Spotify's API.
Moreover, people will be able to see a map with information of places where this app is in use,
such as their location, a description of the place, and which playlist is being used
The principal source of income will be selling the license to use this app to pubs owners. Whether it will
be a monthly/yearly subscription and the pricing is still undecided. On the other hand, voting whichever
songs are in the playlist made by the pub owner will be free to use, although in the future we may be able to come up
with ideas for a premium account with more benefits.
The reason why we think people will be willing to pay for our services is that this will allow not only to
offer a way for people to entertain themselves and listen to what they want, but also it will help them to advertise
themselves and draw new clientes thanks to our map functionality 
Our main goal is to develop a web application, but our intention is to also make a mobile app, which will
be greatly appreciated by the users, as it will make the process of voting the songs more intuitive and 
comfortable. In addition to the funcionalities described,there's a lot of features that can be added to this
application in order to make it grow,such as allowing raffles in order to incentive people to use the app, adding
a large customization for the profiles of the pubs which are using the application and giving them means to advertise themselves
within our application.
