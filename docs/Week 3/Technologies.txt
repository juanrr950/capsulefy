The full project will be developed in Django. There will be a main web application, which will be the website that the
end users will interact with. For styling, Bootstrap will be used. AJAX and Jquery will also be useful at some points.
Then, there will be different applications. Each of them will be focused on one thing: users, capsules or social media.
These will be APIs that use the Django REST Framework package. The users and capsules APIs will make use of a PostgreSQL
database. The social media API may also need a database.
For continuous integration, we will use Travis CI. This website integrates nicely with GitHub.
