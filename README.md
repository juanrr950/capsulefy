# Capsulefy

Capsulefy is an online time capsule that allow users to store their memories and share them in the future. Users will be able to create a time capsule, attach a message to it, load files such as videos or images into it and set a date when they want the capsule to be released.
The capsules can also be connected to the user’s social networks so that a message is automatically posted when the capsule is published. Users will also be able to select a list of emails that will receive a notification message.
One of the main selling points of our product is allowing people to leave a message behind in case they pass away. For this reason, we will offer a dead-man switch option that once activated, will automatically release the capsule regardless of its publication date if the user hasn’t refreshed the counter after a certain period of time.
Our capsules also offer extra features such as the possibility of splitting them into different modules, each of them with a different release date, or making them private so that they won’t appear when listing the capsules.
