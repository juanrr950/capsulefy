For developing the main web application and the different APIs, the used framework will be Django. That means that the
programming language is Python. For the database, we will use PostgreSQL. To integrate with social media, we still have
to test whether OAuth can be used or not. To keep track of tasks and upload all the code, we use a GitHub repository.
For continuous integration, Travis CI will be used, and it will automatically execute the tests and deploy the application
if there are no errors. The hosting platform will be Heroku.

The risks of using Django is potential breakage if any dependency stops working. This has happened before, where a database
would not work after an update and it took about half a month for the bug to be fixed. The integration with social media
presents the risk of not finding a way to schedule future posts. Both GitHub and Travis CI can suffer temporary problems
on their end, which would leave us with no way to quickly deploy the application after making a change. Heroku has the risk
of having problems and also changing their policies and pricing options, as we could find that hosting costs are increased.
